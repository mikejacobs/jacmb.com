    	I joined the UberPool team as the product idea was just beginning to take shape. Along with another designer, we researched, designed, prototyped, tested, launched, and refined the initial uberPool user experience for both riders and drivers. UberPool is available now in many cities, and is one of Uber's most popular offerings. We were awarded a <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20160069694A1/en">patent</a> for one of our UI inventions.

    	I led design of a major feature in the Uber rider app used by city teams to communicate with riders about product launches, fare changes, promotions, service disruptions, etc. The feature included a corresponding WYSIWYG content editing tool for drafting the in-app messages, configuring their behavior, and choosing templated design options.

    	<h6 class="bold">Description</h6>
		As Uber grew, data visualization within the company became inconsistent across teams. Along with another designer from the Data Design team, we set out to design a standardized visual system for all data vis&mdash; internal and external. The map design part of this process was outlined on a <a href="https://medium.com/uber-design/crafting-data-driven-maps-b0835b620554">blog post</a>, and Uber maintains an <a href="https://uber.github.io/react-vis/">open source charting library</a> that heavily utilizes this work. </div>
