  <h3>Small / Weird / Wild Web</h3>
  <p>
    In the rush to the new crop of corporate-owned social media sites, I've chosen a different path. Instead, I'm gleefully riding the resurgence in <a href="https://diagram.website">mom and pop internet</a> (as opposed to the big box sites we all flocked to for quite a while). Though "internet sovereignty"<span class="callout">&midast;</span><span class="sidenote">&midast; An internet system in which the people who produce, distribute, and consume internet also control the mechanisms and policies of internet production and distribution. (This is the wikipedia definition for food sovereignty with the word "internet" replacing instances of "food")</span> is a better description of the ethos I'm seeing and seeking.

    The ongoing redesign of this website <a href="http://textfiles.com/underconstruction/"><img src="../images/construction.gif" style="float:left; margin-right: 20px"></a>was a step in that direction. As was joining Mastodon &mdash; where I am finding more aligned minds and sense of community than I ever did on Twitter etc.

  <h3>A Distributed Farm</h3>
  <p> 
    Along with a lovely group of pals, I am in the process of creating a mutual aid organization. In the simplest of terms, the goal is to grow food with each other, for each other and others that need it. That means growing food in gardens across many locations in the Tucson Metro Area, connecting those that have access to land with those that do not. We help each other grow on the land and we all share in the abundance. Think mutual aid victory gardens with land-, labor-, skill-, and harvest-sharing. In Tucson? Give me a shout.

  <h3>Proyekto</h3>
  <p> 
    A long-running project to make an easy, fun, point-click, drag-drop interface for web publishing. It's along the same lines as the folk interfaces mentioned by <a href="https://cristobal.space/writing/folk.html">Crist√≥bal Sciutto</a> in that it's meant for mostly myself and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@lukexi">@lukexi</a> to make things, but with the aditional use case of sharing the creations. You can <a href="https://proyekt.net">try it out</a>. Be mindful it's a work in progress (see construction gif above) but it'll probably always be a glorious mess.
