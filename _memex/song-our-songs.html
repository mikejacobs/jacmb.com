<h3>Lyrics</h3>
<pre>
Caught in our minds 
like a radio song 
Keeping us here

Waving into everyone
Keeping us away

Rewild our minds
One contagious song 
redirects the dance

You’ve seen everything
Shouldn’t we want change?

(Let’s) sing ourselves into a kind of thought
We hadn’t tried yet
With our own songs to guide us

We’ll find our different dreams
Trying on the ideas
We haven’t worn yet
We haven’t walked in them

Don’t follow time
Showing us
Going forward
We’re looping around

Don’t trip on the line
Telling us
It could be worse
Or without them you’d be dead

Just look away my friend
Too long we were led
Ant trails of pheromones

(Let’s) sing ourselves into a kind of thought
We hadn’t tried yet
With our own songs to guide us

We’ll find our different dreams
Trying on the ideas
We haven’t worn yet
We haven’t walked in them

</pre>
