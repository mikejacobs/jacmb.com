    <h3><a id="technology">A loaded, non-trivial question</a></h3>
    <p>
        A while back, a friend sent me a <a href="https://twitter.com/captgouda24/status/1780345152885641350">post</a> that was doing numbers in the tech startup and economics corners of social media that I generally steer clear of these days. I don't like embedding those things so here's the initial question, paraphrasing a screenshot of an economic study:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        Why are worker’s cooperatives so rare? This is not a trivial question — because they can pay “dividends” in the form of wages, they can entirely avoid corporate income tax. They must be so inefficient by nature of their structure to outweigh their advantages.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        And a <a href="https://twitter.com/captgouda24/status/1780345158959034804">follow-up</a> with another screenshot from the study:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        The key is that, since wages are set by vote, those workers who are below average are able to redistribute from the most productive to the least. Because you have to make a [tax] contribution, it is more expensive to leave — and so incentives are distorted
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        I've been thinking about it ever since and wanted to take a crack at dispelling this set of views. The short answer to the question: because worker co-ops genuinely run counter to the hegemonic power structure of the US. While we sing the virtues of democracy, tout the US as a democratic country, and do all kinds of imperialism to spread it to other countries, the governance model of our corporations&mdash; the driving force of our economic power, and often the most influential governing organization for most citizen's lives&mdash; is undeniably undemocratic.<side-note>Closer to aristocratic or plutocratic.</side-note> Co-ops, especially worker co-ops, change this. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Co-ops are operating in a hostile environment <side-note>The US economy not only structurally favors corporations, but is overrun with backdealing and monopoly tactics that buy politicians and regulators to ensure their continued success.</side-note> and the issues can be tracked to ideological and cultural hostility. Posts like the one we're dissecting are frequent and represent a majority view from those with money and power in the US. There are a number of overlapping reasons I could give to account for the lack of worker co-ops:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Being a lesser-traveled road, worker co-ops are more difficult to start and run
            <ul>
                <li>There are fewer examples to point to and learn from</li>
                <li>Less knowledge to reference</li>
                <li>Fewer businessy resources like helpful orgs, classes, incubators, etc.</li>
                <li>There is less awareness that worker co-ops are even an option for doing business<side-note>I can't think of one movie or TV show that involves a worker co-op</side-note></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Funding is difficult.
            <ul>
                <li>Investors aren't attracted to worker co-ops because the ownership structure doesn't allow for selling off big chunks</li>
                <li>Investors also tend to want bigger investment returns than a worker co-op can promise</li>
                <li>Banks sometimes offer loans but they tend to be smaller, that is if the bank doesn't hold the business cultural bias against worker co-ops </li>
                <li>There are a <a href="https://seedcommons.org/">few</a> non-extractive funding options, but they are limited.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>US culture's fervent individualism blinds us to the benefits of cooperative work.
            <ul>
                <li>We're still somehow holding onto meritocratic ideas of the American Dream</li>
                <li>Great Man theory has a very strong presence in our views of human ability and progress,<side-note>Along with Bad Apple theory. These two are used to entirely replace discussion of systemic influence.</side-note>while there are few stories of collective struggle and success</li>
                <li>Mainstream political views on both sides hold entrepeneurialism as virtuous without acknowledging the role of generational wealth and power</li>
                <li>Cold War echos color co-ops as scary reds</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>US business and economics have a vested interest to scuttle worker co-ops.
            <ul>
                <li>They are inclined to believe that people are motivated purely by self-interest&mdash; the cynicism runs deep.</li>
                <li>A viable, redistributive alternative is a threat to corporate hegemony.</li>
                <li>Monopolists play dirty to crush small business, including co-ops</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    This is a selection of a longer post I am working on that goes into more depth on economists' flawed concepts of efficiency and worker motivations, as well as how those concepts negatively shape our perceptions of work.
