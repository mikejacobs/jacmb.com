    A friend recently sent me a <a href="https://twitter.com/captgouda24/status/1780345152885641350">post</a> from the tech startup and economics corners of social media that I generally steer clear of these days. I don't like embedding those things so here's the initial question:
    <blockquote>Why are worker’s cooperatives so rare? This is not a trivial question — because they can pay “dividends” in the form of wages, they can entirely avoid corporate income tax. They must be so inefficient by nature of their structure to outweigh their advantages.</blockquote>

    The quick answers are:
    <ul>
    <li>Business culture looks down on cooperatives</li>
    <li>Investors aren't attracted to cooperatives so funding is difficult</li>
    <li>Monopoly capitalism crushes cooperatives</li>
    </ul>
