<h3>Lyrics</h3>
<pre>
As soon as you can walk
They put you on the wire
Saying you could make yourself into something
As long as it's for sale

We’re walking on the wire
With everyone alive
One way to go 
It’s all we’ll ever know

Disect your thoughts and break your power
We dont want them coming from the top

Walking on the wire 
with everyone alive
One way to go 
its all we'll ever know
(without a net)
it's all you get
(without a net)
to the end
without a net

Falling off the wire
Without a net

As soon as you can walk
They put you on the wire
You can move yourself
As long as it's in your lane

Walking on the wire
With everyone alive
Doesn't matter we're tired x 2
We're tired x 3

Falling off the wire
Without a net

</pre>
