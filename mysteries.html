    <dt>I often wake up sneezing.</dt>
      <dd>Is it my allergy to dust mites? </dd>

    <dt>I have some kind of blood sugar sensitivity.</dt>
      <dd>If I go too long between meals, I can sometimes become hangry. I have learned to notice this and carry snacks. I've also noticed it is much more pronounced if I am coming down from a strong cup of coffee.</dd>
