<i>“The ultimate, hidden truth of the world is that it is something that we make, and could just as easily make differently […] the hidden reality of human life is the fact that the world doesn’t just happen. It isn’t a natural fact, even though we tend to treat it as if it is―it exists because we all collectively produce it.”</i>
