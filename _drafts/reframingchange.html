    <blockquote>
        "What are the consequences of the stories we tell? What do stories do? What do we do with the stories we tell? How do you change your story and how does that change the world?  We often pretend that stories are givens, it's just that way. There are facts: measels are contageous, guns can kill people. But then there are [stories like]: you are my enemy, I'm right about this, there is only one way to do this [...] We've built these houses out of stories&mdash; take up residence in them. And in one way they're invivible to us. We don't say: 'I could be living in a completely different story'. And another way we see them, but see them as inevitable when we don't see ourselves as the storytellers. And so much, I think, of becoming free is becoming the storyteller of our own story. Of choosing to define who you are, what you're here for, and what your possibilities are."

        I have found there are three essential parts to internalizing the possibility of change.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Knowing things haven't always been this way, and won't be this way forever</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Look back: pre-colonial native american societies, pirate kings, zapatistas.</li>
            <li>Understanding the framings we're caught in now</li>
            <li>Beware historical projection and capitalist realism - we retell the story of the past to neatly fit our currently reality as the natural consequence, justifying it</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Shifting your perspective on what is possible</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Considering paths you might have rejected or been discouraged from following
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Setting your expectations: real change won't happen over night</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Not always linear, not always head on. Dual power</li>
            <li>Might not happen in our lifetime</li>

    <h3>Things haven't always been this way</h3>    
    <p>
        I am currently obsessed with <a href="framing.html">framing and reframing</a>. In the above quote, Graeber does a fantastic job of expanding our definition of what is possible. The ultimate reframing is changing the bounds of what we think can be changed. I recommend reading the whole book because Graeber's sense of possiblity comes from a deep study of history. He tells of times when things were different, and times when people did recognize their ability to change the world&mdash; exercising their <b>power</b>.*<span class="sidenote">* Understanding the effects of social heirarchy, power disparities, and domination are essential framings of an anarchist perspective. <a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-what-is-social-ecology">anarchist view of the world</a> is one of  domination is the primary driver of change in history.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        This is one of those thought technologies that has shifted my sense of self, and has led me on a path to change my priorities in life. It has given me hope, optimisim, and renewed interest in the world. I always found history boring until I realized that I felt empowered learning how things have not always been like this.
    </p>
    <p>
        A primary requirement for a dominant ideology is making a convincing case that it is the natural order of the world. In the case of capitalism, Mark Fischer articulated it best in Capitalist Realism:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "the widespread sense that not only is capitalism the only viable political and economic system, but also that it is now impossible even to imagine a coherent alternative to it."

    <blockquote>
        “the ultimate, hidden truth of the world is that it is something that we make, and could just as easily make differently […] the hidden reality of human life is the fact that the world doesn’t just happen. It isn’t a natural fact, even though we tend to treat it as if it is—it exists because we all collectively produce it.”

        <!-- *<span class="sidenote">*My all-time favorite quote from my all-time favorite author. The whole book is great, go read it right now!</span> -->
    </p>
    <p>
        It's a common mistake to think of change and power within the bounds of the systems we exist in and are familiar with: as an individual, as a citizen, as a worker, as a consumer. Each of those contexts have routes to change that is acceptable, and often the unacceptable routes are not clear until you find yourself on the wrong side of a power disparity. Our route to change as a US citizen means contacting a representative and voting. As an employee it means talking to your boss, joining a union, or possibly leaving a bad job. As a consumer it means contacting the company, buying a different product, or even advocating for others to boycot the product.
    </p>
    <p>
        But what do you do when your problem isn't fixed by those actions? What
        do you do when there are deep systemic problems
    </p>
    <p>
        But those systems are what define the bounds of our power, and
        artificially limit or control it to create heirarchies used to direct
        our behavior and exploit us.
    </p>
    <h3>Revolution</h3>
    <p>
        <img src="/images/snowpiercer.jpg" style="width: 45%; float: right; margin-left: 5%">
        In the US, we have two popular understanding of change:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Change within our political process and economic system: voting, writing your congress-person, volunteering, conscious consumption, and so on.</li>
        <li>Change outside the political process: armed struggle, violent clashes, coup d'état, protests, strikes, etc</li>
    </ul>
    <p> is one of . Those that want power try to unseat those in power, and grab the wheel once they're out. While those might cause a turn in the giant </p>

    <h3>Where does our power end?</h3>
    <p>
        Power is real, though it's mostly not talked about explicitly in US society. But there is no escaping power disparities. The limits of our power, both perceived and actual, so strongly affect our reality that they define what we believe we can do; our ability to change the world; and what is possible if we work together. The sense of your own power is a powerful frame. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We all know that the boss has power to make decisions at work, and we
        have to follow orders. We all know that politicians have the power to
        make laws and enforce them through policing. We don't often talk about
        how we give that power to them, and if all chose to no longer give it to
        them, that power would evaporate.
    </p>
    <p>
        That might seem naive or silly. It might seem obvious to you that this
        process of laws and enforcement is how we stay safe, or that bosses make
        decisions because they've earned the position or they're qualified. But,
        I encourage you to separate the needs for safety and leadership from the
        power to unilaterally decide what life and work look like for other
        people. This is how power disparities have been framed, for our
        protection, for our benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
        The reality is we are manipulated into giving up our power. It may not
        feel like that's what has happened, because it's all we've ever known,
        and it's usually framed as the price of participation, or just the way
        things work. In exchange, we get access to money which gets us basic
        necessities we need to live.
    </p>
    <p>
        The success of this manipulation also lies in the complete capturing of the mechanisms for change. Don't like the way a politician is doing something? Vote them out. Don't like a boss? Leave your job. Those might seem like freedoms, but they aren't acutally fixes for a few reasons. Leaving a job isn't possible if your financial situation doesn't allow, as is true for most Americans. There is no alternative to the way government works, and it's been shown to prioritize the needs of those that fund campaigns. It makes little difference who is in office when the system inevitably makes them compromise for donations. When the proposed solution means more succumbing to the manipulation, it's not a solution. When the power disparity is part of a system, the system needs to be changed.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, what if we start to extend our notion of change to look outside of
        these acceptable paths? This is what the David Graeber quote at the top
        is about.
    </p>
    <h3>What does power look like?</h3>
    <p>
        Power is easier to see when it is put in less abstract terms. Do you
        need medical care but can't afford it? Do you live in fear of losing a
        job and becoming destitute? Do you work at a job you dislike? All of
        these are situations that speak to an inability to change your
        circumstances. Medical care is expensive and
    </p>
    <h3>Just look away, my friend</h3>
    <p>
        A main mechanism of power is attention. Paying attention, even negative
        attention, to Donald Trump gives him power. A world where every person
        is able to work toward their meeting their needs.
