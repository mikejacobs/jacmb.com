        I have chewed on David Graeber's words for years. Through much rumination, I believe they are now an essential part of my worldview. I'm still figuring out how I got here, but I think I've identified three big steps in my path to internalizing the possibility of change.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Change is ongoing and inevitable</li>
<!--         <ul>
            <li> Knowing things haven't always been this way, and won't be this way forever</li>
            <li>Look back: pre-colonial native American societies, pirate kings, Zapatistas.</li>
            <li>Understanding the framings we're caught in now</li>
            <li>Beware historical projection and capitalist realism - we retell the story of the past to neatly fit our currently reality as the natural consequence, justifying it</li>
        </ul> -->
        <li>Shifting your perspective on what is possible</li>
<!--         <ul>
            <li>
                Considering paths you might have rejected or been discouraged from following
            </li>
        </ul> -->
        <li>Setting your expectations</li>
<!--         <ul>
            <li>real change won't happen over night</li>
            <li>Not always linear, not always head on. Dual power</li>
            <li>Might not happen in our lifetime</li>

    <h3>1. Change is ongoing and inevitable</h3>    
    <h4>Reframe the past, present, and future</h4>    
    <p>
        Things haven't always been this way and they won't be this way forever. We don't have to work hard just to live in a world that prioritizes making money over our well-being. We aren't destined to struggle in the cyberpunk dystopias we see depicted in movies, TV, and video games. It may seem that way because we don't often encounter stories that tell of the future in an optimistic sense. I don't mean moralized stories where the difference is highlighted, I mean stories that have this optimism as the backdrop for a meaningful story. In cyberpunk movies we have some sort of tension and redemptive story arch. The same can be true of any future. :/
    </p>
    <h4>Seek out criticism and alternative histories</h4>
    <p>
        Who are the victors that write history? What are the alternative accounts? Was the US discovered and defended or was it won through genocide? Get your head out of the feedback loop of neoliberalism
    </p>
    <p>
        Read the People's History of The United States, read Chomsky's books on American imperialism, read Graeber and Wengrow's The Dawn of Everything, Google Bookchin, watch Andrewism videos, and listen to Seriously Wrong episodes. Read Marx's analysis and criticisms of capitalism. Read Kropotkin and <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/bookchin/1969/listen-marxist.htm">Bookchin's</a> disagreements with Marx on the subject of authoritarianism.
    </p>
    <p>
        
    </p>
    <p>
        I am currently obsessed with <a href="framing.html">framing and reframing</a>. In the quote up top, Graeber does a fantastic job of expanding our definition of what is possible. The ultimate reframing is changing the bounds of what we think can be changed. I recommend reading the whole book because Graeber's sense of possibility comes from a deep study of history. He tells of times when things were different, and times when people did recognize their ability to change the world&horbar; exercising their <b>power</b>.*<span class="sidenote">* Understanding the effects of social hierarchy, power disparities, and domination are essential framings of an anarchist perspective. <a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-what-is-social-ecology">anarchist view of the world</a> is one of  domination is the primary driver of change in history.</span> Let go of the neoliberal definition of progress. Progress is not linear. Progress is not defined by technological advancement alone. We may live like kings in some ways and like paupers in others. I've come to believe that if progress does not apply to everyone, it's part of the problem of perpetuating a divide among people.

        This is one of those thought technologies that has shifted my sense of self, and has led me on a path to change my priorities in life. It has given me hope, optimism, and renewed interest in the world. I always found history boring until I realized that I felt empowered learning how other people lived with less technological advancement 
    </p>
    <p>
        A primary requirement for a dominant ideology is making a convincing case that it is the natural order of the world. In the case of capitalism, Mark Fischer articulated it best in Capitalist Realism:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "the widespread sense that not only is capitalism the only viable political and economic system, but also that it is now impossible even to imagine a coherent alternative to it."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        If you are like me, and you believe capitalist domination is at fault for our climate emergency, our social ills, and . From that perspective, it's a critical

    </p>
    <h3>2. Shifting your perspective</h3>
    
    <p>
        It's a common mistake to think of change and power within the bounds of the systems we exist in and are familiar with: as an individual, as a citizen, as a worker, as a consumer. Each of those contexts have routes to change that is acceptable, and often the unacceptable routes are not clear until you find yourself on the wrong side of a power disparity. Our route to change as a US citizen means contacting a representative and voting. As an employee it means talking to your boss, joining a union, or possibly leaving a bad job. As a consumer it means contacting the company, buying a different product, or even advocating for others to boycott the product.
    </p>
    <p>
        But what do you do when your problem isn't fixed by those actions? What
        do you do when there are deep systemic problems that make 
    </p>
    <p>
        But those systems are what define the bounds of our power, and
        artificially limit or control it to create hierarchies used to direct
        our behavior and exploit us.
    </p>
    <p>What are the invisible structures that govern our lives. How can we bypass them or break them down?</p>
    <h4>Consider all paths</h4>
    <p>
        Our worldview is a garden (that's seems to be a theme here) that we must cultivate and prune. If you are really searching for a new direction, you will continually be looking for new ideas but also checking in on old ones that you hold or have rejected. 
    </p>





    <blockquote>
        "Only a crisis - actual or perceived - produces real change. When that crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around. That, I believe, is our basic function: to develop alternatives to existing policies, to keep them alive and available until the politically impossible becomes the politically inevitable."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Milton Friedman, <em>Capitalism and Freedom</em>*<aside>* His awful ideas are part of the reason we continue to exist in this mess, but he makes a very good point here.</aside>
    </p>
    <h3>3. Setting your expectations</h3>
    <h4>Revolution</h4>
    <p>
        <img src="/images/snowpiercer.jpg" style="width: 45%; float: right; margin-left: 5%">
        In the US, we have two popular understanding of change:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Change within our political process and economic system: voting, writing your congress-person, volunteering, conscious consumption, and so on.</li>
        <li>Change outside the political process: armed struggle, violent clashes, coup d'état, protests, strikes, etc</li>
    </ul>
    <p> is one of . Those that want power try to unseat those in power, and grab the wheel once they're out. While those might cause a turn in the giant </p>
    <p>When more rapid change happens, people look around for other ideas that are out there. Make </p>
    <h4>Where does our power end?</h4>
    <p>
        Power is real, though it's mostly not talked about explicitly in US society. But there is no escaping power disparities. The limits of our power, both perceived and actual, so strongly affect our reality that they define what we believe we can do; our ability to change the world; and what is possible if we work together. The sense of your own power is a powerful frame. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We all know that the boss has power to make decisions at work, and we
        have to follow orders. We all know that politicians have the power to
        make laws and enforce them through policing. We don't often talk about
        how we give that power to them, and if all chose to no longer give it to
        them, that power would evaporate.
    </p>
    <p>
        That might seem naive or silly. It might seem obvious to you that this
        process of laws and enforcement is how we stay safe, or that bosses make
        decisions because they've earned the position or they're qualified. But,
        I encourage you to separate the needs for safety and leadership from the
        power to unilaterally decide what life and work look like for other
        people. This is how power disparities have been framed, for our
        protection, for our benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
        The reality is we are manipulated into giving up our power. It may not
        feel like that's what has happened, because it's all we've ever known,
        and it's usually framed as the price of participation, or just the way
        things work. In exchange, we get access to money which gets us basic
        necessities we need to live.
    </p>
    <p>
        The success of this manipulation also lies in the complete capturing of the mechanisms for change. Don't like the way a politician is doing something? Vote them out. Don't like a boss? Leave your job. Those might seem like freedoms, but they aren't actually fixes for a few reasons. Leaving a job isn't possible if your financial situation doesn't allow, as is true for most Americans. There is no alternative to the way government works, and it's been shown to prioritize the needs of those that fund campaigns. It makes little difference who is in office when the system inevitably makes them compromise for donations. When the proposed solution means more succumbing to the manipulation, it's not a solution. When the power disparity is part of a system, the system needs to be changed.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, what if we start to extend our notion of change to look outside of
        these acceptable paths? This is what the David Graeber quote at the top
        is about.
    </p>
    <h4>What does power look like?</h4>
    <p>
        Power is easier to see when it is put in less abstract terms. Do you
        need medical care but can't afford it? Do you live in fear of losing a
        job and becoming destitute? Do you work at a job you dislike? All of
        these are situations that speak to an inability to change your
        circumstances. Medical care is expensive and
    </p>
    <h4>Just look away, my friend</h4>
    <p>
        A main mechanism of power is attention. Paying attention, even negative
        attention, to Donald Trump gives him power. A world where every person
        is able to work toward their meeting their needs.
