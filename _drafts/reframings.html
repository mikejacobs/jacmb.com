	<h3>&lt;Business&gt; is good because it creates jobs.</h3>
	<p>
		Jobs are seen as good in our society because they give people money to afford necessities and pay for streaming television. From a neoliberal capitalist perspective, this is a positive in so far as it incentives people to participate in our economy both through selling their labor and in buying the results of other people's labor. In fact, this is their definition of "freedom". 
	</p>
	<p>
		The problem with this story is it doesn't account for the brutality of withholding the means of survival in a system that may not even be able to provide a job for someone, and accessiblity of different jobs varies wildly based on the class and wealth you were born into. Monopolistic enterprises tend to concentrate wealth over time creating a coersive environment that limits the choices of working people in how they participate in the economy.</p>

	<h3>Cars give you the most freedom compared to other transportation</h3>

	<h3>We're meant to live in isolation and work outside our community</h3>
	<p></p>
	<h3>Money is the best way of compensating someone for work</h3>
	<p></p>
	<h3>Food should be grown in enormous factory-like fields</h3>
	<p></p>
	<h3>This company is a family</h3>
	<p>
		It's assumed that care and generosity come with a family. Employees approaching work with that attitude helps a workplace run smoothly, which benefits the company. But in reality that care and generosity are an extremely conditional rarity when coming from the company back to the employees.

	<h3>This is a transformative technology</h3>
