<p>Framing is so important. It not only sets the bounds for an argument but it shapes your sense of what is possible. When someone tries to tell you a thing is impossible (I.e. peace in the Middle East). Before you let that sink in, I like to think about the bounds of possibility in that persons mind. Is it impossible for Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace? Or is it impossible within the bounds of acceptability according to some collection of ideologies? </p>

<p>If you listen only to what people say, </p>

<p>Framing and perspective. I always have to remind myself to examine anything said through those lenses. Thatâ€™s how you get two groups accusing each other of genocide. </p> -->
