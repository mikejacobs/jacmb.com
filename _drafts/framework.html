    <blockquote>
        "What are the consequences of the stories we tell? What do stories do? What do we do with the stories we tell? How do you change your story and how does that change the world?  We often pretend that stories are givens, it's just that way. There are facts: measels are contageous, guns can kill people. But then there are [stories like]: you are my enemy, I'm right about this, there is only one way to do this [...] We've built these houses out of stories&mdash; take up residence in them. And in one way they're invivible to us. We don't say: 'I could be living in a completely different story'. And another way we see them, but see them as inevitable when we don't see ourselves as the storytellers. And so much, I think, of becoming free is becoming the storyteller of our own story; choosing to define who you are, what you're here for, and what your possibilities are."

	<p>
		In the same way that all the man-made objects around us were dreamed up by someone, then designed, constructed, and transported to us, so were our ideas. Our worldviews are an overlapping mess of frames, a stew of stories that helps us make sense of the world with ingredients collected from parents, teachers, politicians, media, and the billboard that caught you at just the right moment.
	</p>
	<p>
		A frame is an angle, and the world looks different from behind each one, making situations and activities slippery and subjective.&sext;<span class="sidenote">&sext; From the angle of quantum physics, even solid ground isn't solid. "Everything we call real is made of things that cannot be regarded as real.” – Niels Bohr</span> Though they become more solid and certain to us when they're shared by others, that can't be the only criteria for an ideology of frames.
		<!-- Sometimes we don't see a thing until we have a name or frame for it&mdash; then it's everywhere.  -->
	</p>
	<!-- <p>
		Of course, there are the framings we're used to thinking about, the blatantly manipulative ones. That beer won't make you popular. That candidate doesn't have a fix for everything. But, my interest is in the larger, ambient frames&horbar;where the rubber of ideas meet the road of reality. The lenses we wear everyday that color the world around us and bound our sense of what is possible. 
	</p> -->
<!-- 	<p>
		Examine the story stew. What’s the base? What's its container? And what's the room in which you’re eating it? (Taking a snack break.)

	</p> -->

<!-- 	<p>
		As Rebecca Solnit describes in the quote up top, narrative framing doesn't have an agenda. It can be a statement of fact or it can be the arena in which an argument is made. Either way, it sets the bounds of the ideas we internalize that then shape how we perceive the world. 
	</p> -->
<!-- 	<ul>
		<li>Democracy is a frame</li>
		<li>Religion is a frame</li>
		<li>Capitalism is a frame*<aside>* "We live in capitalism. Its power seems inescapable. So did the divine right of kings. Any human power can be resisted and changed by human beings." - <a href="https://www.ursulakleguin.com/nbf-medal">Ursula K. Le Guin</a></aside></li>
		<li>Kindness is a frame</li>

		<li>The setting of a movie is a frame</li>
		<li>The sales pitch for a product is a frame</li>
		<li>The perspective of a writer is a frame</li>
	</ul> -->
	<p>
		Shared frames make the fabric of our society and the walls of the invisible structures that govern our lives. They can also be contradictory, or fanciful, or due for reconsideration. And it's worth noting that they're always incomplete because raw reality is full of <a href="https://www.hcn.org/issues/47.1/introducing-the-idea-of-hyperobjects">hyperobjects</a>  our dinky brains are underequipped to comprehend.&sext;<span class="sidenote">&sext; If ever there was a sentiment that gets at my non-religious spirituality, it's this.

			<!-- We are swimming in frames that orient our perspective in line with all kinds of ideologies.  -->
			To add even more wrinkles, society is constantly trying to modify our frames or slyly slip another one on the pile. This underlines the importance of understanding how framing works, especially when it's used as a tool for manipulation.

		<h4>Manipulative Framing</h4>

			Often, we talk about <a href="https://practicalpie.com/the-framing-effect-definition-examples/">manipulative framing</a> as if it only applies to sales and politics&horbar;thinly veiled attempts to get us to buy goods or politicians. While it's important to know that the beer from the ad won't make you interesting, that isn't life-changing for most of us. 
		</p>
		<!-- <ul> -->
<!-- 			<li>Advertisers frame their products as necessities when they're not</li>
			<li>Politicians convince you to be afraid of the world then position themselves as the savior</li> -->
			<!-- <li>White supremicists say diversity is an attack to paint themselves as the victims</li> -->
			<!-- <li>Misogynists say feminism makes them feel uncomfortable because they want to continue the patriarchy</li> -->
<!-- 			<li>The US military <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/ideas/how-hollywood-became-the-unofficial-propaganda-arm-of-the-u-s-military-1.5560575">subsidizes films</a> to paint them in a positive light as a way to ensure support for American imperialism</li>
			<li>Capitalists say your job is necessary for your survival then do everything in their power to ensure that's true</li> -->
			<!-- <li>The American Dream says your hard work will be rewarded, yet many hard working people fall through the cracks</li> -->
		<!-- </ul> -->
		<!-- <p><a href="#examples">And others...</a></p> -->
		<!-- <p>
			An example: I give money to someone that is begging on the sidewalk. Two of the common ways of framing this act paint it positively (charity) or negatively (enabling)*<span class="sidenote">* There are, of course, other ways to view this but I wanted to choose two that people often encounter.</span>. The charity framing comes from a worldview that acknowledges people fall on hard times and encourages helping in ways that we can. The enabling framing says that success comes to those that work hard to get it and giving someone money that is not working for it is hurting their chances at success. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Though I have strong opinions about them both, I won't get into the differences in ideologies here. The point is these are <em>wildly</em> different ways to view an action. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Even before we do the action, we have subconsciously considered the framings that are known to us and chosen an action that fits an ideology. There are of course other ways to frame this situation that could lead to very different actions. To list a few others:
		</p>
		<dl style="margin-left:15px">
			<dt>Judgemental charity</dt>
			<dd>I decide to only give this person food, because I worry they might use money to buy drugs or alcohol.</dd>
			<dt>Non-judgmental inclusion / Mutual aid</dt>
			<dd>I invite the person to the food pantry, church, or other community organization because that's where I have received support</dd>
			<dt>Meritocratic paternalism</dt>
			<dd>I tell them to stop being lazy and get a job</dd>
			<dt>Non-judgmental curiosity</dt>
			<dd>I stop to talk to the person to understand their situation with the idea that maybe I could more meaningfully help if I knew more</dd>
			<dt>Busy; focused on self</dt>
			<dd>I am too busy to do anything so I keep walking</dd>
			<dt>Afraid; focused on self</dt>
			<dd>I am afraid of this person so I uncomfortably keep walking</dd>
		</dl> -->
	<!-- 	<ul>
			<li>I decide to only give this person food, because I worry they might use money to buy drugs or alcohol.</li>
			<li>I invite the person to the food pantry, or church, or other community organization because that's where I have received support</li>

			Clearly, not all framing is harmful to you or others, but it's important to be able to recognize when something is framed to manipulate us. Some reasons people choose manipulative framing: 
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>lead us to a conclusion about an event</li>
			<li>get us to agree with a falsehood or partial truth</li>
			<li>get our consent to allow something to be done to us or on our behalf</li>
			<li>convince us to buy something</li>
			<li>influence our vote in an election</li>
			<li>leading us to choose from an artificially limited set of options</li>
			<li>leading us to obedience, conformity, or inaction</li>
			<li>leading us to adopt a view for their validation</li>
		</ul> -->

		<p>
			Manipulative framing is so pervasive that, without a proper defense, we often aren't aware that it's even happening. A secret, mind-altering spell. And because framing is a rhetorical device that shapes ideas, if it's successfully received, the frame is self-reproducing and spreads to others. By acting and communicating within them en masse, we reshape the world to fit our frames, sometimes at great cost to those that are unjustly on the wrong side of the shades.
		</p>
		<p>
			This leads us to my interest in the larger, ambient frames&horbar;where the rubber of ideas meets the road of reality. The lenses we unknowingly wear everyday that color the world around us and bound our sense of what is possible. The bowl, table, and room in which we consume the story stew mentioned above.
		</p>
	<h4>Scope Limiting</h4>
	<p>
		A subset of manipulative framing that's worth calling out is one that specifically has the effect of disempowering and limiting a possibility space. It can be purposefully coersive or incidental. An example would be ...

		<!-- one from the tech industry and startup culture. There is a lot of talk of "creative destruction" and "innovation" in this culture, while all of this happens on a foundation of predatory investment practices from venture capitalists and a cult-like, meritocratic mythos. Want to build something that doesn't further concentrate wealth and power into the hands of venture capital? Good luck. -->
	</p>
	<!-- 	<p>Examples of statements that have manipulative framing:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>"Healthcare should be available to all."</li>
			<li>"This is a transformative technology."</li>
			<li>"This company is a family."</li>
			<li>"Without incentive, no one would work or innovate."</li>
		</ul> -->

<section>
	<h3><a id="defense">Defensive Reframing</a></h3>
	<p>
		Thankfully, we don't have to be passive in the framing process. We have the power to reframe as a defense against this rhetorical device. There are questions we can ask ourselves to get at framing when it may not be apparent. A counter spell, or a spell revealer at least. I'm certainly not immune to its effects, but, I have found that with practice, it's possible to position these questions as filters in our information intake process.
	</p>
	<p>Examples of questions useful in reframing:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>How does this person benefit from telling me this?</li>
		<!-- <li>Who owns this?</li> -->
		<li>Does this statement only apply to a limited group?</li>
		<li>Does this statement present the whole situation or just part?</li>
		<li>Why is this information being shown to me?</li>
		<li>Who benefits from me acting in a certain way?</li>
		<li>Who stands to gain from the options presented or excluded?</li>
		<li>Who stands to gain from my work?</li>
		<li>Will anything change if I do something different?</li>
		<li>Who is in power in this situation?</li>
		<li>Who is powerless in this situation?</li>
		<li>Why is someone resisting a change?</li>
		<li>Are there key words that may be misleading?</li>
		<li>At what level in a process do I feel empowered to act?</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<img src="/images/frames2.jpg" class="full">
	</p>
	<p>
		This is a route to a different reality. Feeling stuck? Here's your map. But, there's one more thing you'll need if you hope to get unstuck. And to be honest, it's more difficult than the reframing mentioned above. As with any kind of adventure, you need to be ok with being changed. You need to be ok with being wrong and realizing you have wronged others. We all have, however indirectly. Openness to this takes courage. There is a real vulnerability in this kind of exploration. You need to start asking yourself these questions (and others like them) to pick apart the rotten bits of your foundational worldview. Unschool yourself of the detrimental wahtnot. You're going to feel lost. But, I am writing this to tell you of the wonderful and loving sense of belonging on the other side of that journey. The alternative is living with the world as it's handed to you, which we already know is a mixture of truths and manipulations. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I won't lie. From here the path is difficult. You will find things about yourself that may not sit well. How have you perpetuated the unjustness of our society? How have you been manipulated to do so? And some of these things may not be immediately changable. Your survival takes priority over any kind of ideological change. This is the compromised state we find ourselves in. But, this process of recognizing wrong and putting it in context is the way forward. Realize that you're doing the work. I have cultivated a deep current of anger at the many realizations of these manipulations and the sad reality is that I can only do so much to right the wrongs. The key is to direct that anger somewhere positive and productive. Otherwise it eats away at you. If you have personally done wrong, do what you can to correct it and ensure you don't do it again. But, recognize that

			<dl>
				<dt>"This company is a family."</dt>
  				<dd>Q: Who benefits from me acting in a certain way?</dd>
  				<dd>A: It's assumed that care and generosity come with a family. Employees approaching work with that attitude helps a workplace run smoothly. But in reality that care and generosity are an extremely conditional rarity when coming from the company back to the employees.</dd>

<!-- 
<p>Framing is so important. It not only sets the bounds for an argument but it shapes your sense of what is possible. When someone tries to tell you a thing is impossible (I.e. peace in the Middle East). Before you let that sink in, I like to think about the bounds of possibility in that persons mind. Is it impossible for Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace? Or is it impossible within the bounds of acceptability according to some collection of ideologies? </p>

<p>If you listen only to what people say, </p>

<p>Framing and perspective. I always have to remind myself to examine anything said through those lenses. That’s how you get two groups accusing each other of genocide. </p> -->
