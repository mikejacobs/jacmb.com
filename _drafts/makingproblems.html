  <h3>
    Solving Problems or Making Them Worse
  </h3>
  <h4>
    Overview
  </h4>
  <p>
    So you have identified a problem. And maybe you even have an idea for how to fix it with technology. Great! You think it could make people's lives better; their work easier; or just make you a living in this dog-eat-dog world. Want to do “good” work? Here’s a framework I use to judge the effect of my work.

    What is the future that I'm working towards? Does the change I’m working on lead to more options and a better possible future, or does it further entrench the circumstances that gave us the problem?
  </p>
  <p>
    I believe both are not only possible but necessary. How can I do work now so that real change is made in the general direction of the vision? Does the change I’m working on lead to more options and a better possible future, or does it further entrench the circumstances that gave us the problem? Often, when looking for fixes, we turn to the same machine that gave us the problem. These are appealing because they’re acceptable, palatable, safe. This is the trap of neoliberalism: austerity produces social ills which we then try to fix with more austerity.

    Or we change a brutal system to be less blunt and immediately painful, but the system still exists.
