    Notes
  </h4>
  <p>
    I’ve come to believe that the current approach to building software is a recipe for creating and maintaining power disparities.
  </p>

    The infinite reproducibility and near universal executability of code is a double edged sword (where did this saying come from? What does it mean?). No reproduction cost and push-button, direct-to-consumer fulfillment. On the one hand, it costs next to nothing to transmit and execute code assuming you have a device that runs it. That means anyone can use a technology I create, today. This is incredible.
  </p>
  <p>
    From a business and profit seeking perspective software is a capitalists dream. Up front costs, but infinite copies. Still have maintenance costs but being closed and centrally produced, maintenance can be monetized as well. Those things coupled with monopolistic practices create a scenario ripe for lock-in and enshitification.

    (Another example of scenario where you should apply the framing lens: Where are the boundaries? What is the framing? Who does this benefit?)

    I used to be a startup guy. From 2006 to 2022 I worked in just about every part of software development: founder, employee, designer, programmer, product manager. I learned of the hubris and delusion that exists in that world. Design is dishonest about it, claiming to listen to needs of software users, and make things for people. Thinking that design tools and process will always result in the best design possible is a harmful delusion, when in fact I would argue it’s the mechanism of coercion big tech uses to exploit us (turn us into attention products for advertisers or get us to work longer harder blah blah). The design process is often employed within the bounds of a business model, a nation state, and countless other ideologies. These serve as lenses that the designer may not realize exist, or are simply considered immovable constraints/ obstacles. Either way, they are slotted into the design process as constraints. The designers job is often to make palatable  features that are primarily meant to increase profits and sometimes meant to coerce them.

    Lately google has gotten heat for the quality of their search (find links). What would search look like. Google is a black box. Its power comes from their ability to decide what shows up in the first page of results. I can’t make any solid claims about that goes on there other than what has been reported by others and the knowledge that search ads are 9X% of googles revenue. As a massive company beholden to quarterly shareholder pressure to increase returns, we can assume that Google is trying to squeeze every dollar out of search. The goal is not always aligned with our goals as users, and thus we get a perverse incentive for Google to sell itself to us as a neutral

    Collective Ownership and Development
  </h3>
  <p>
    Open source software isn’t enough. In light of my views on abstraction. Participatory design isn't enough if the software isn't owned by the participants.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’d like to propose the idea of peoples software.
  </p>
  <p>
    // Dinky
The peoples software
Small 
built to specific needs by people that need it
cooperative
Open, inspectable
repairable 
knowable 
learnable 
Extendable
Governable on a community scale (not through politicians)
shared ownership
Leaveable
transparent magic (could write a whole post on why magic without explanation is bad, I don’t think explanations ruin good magic it makes it even better to appreciate the skill)
  </p>
  <p>
    Corporate software
Shitty
Large, monopolistic
Generalized for an abstract ideal set of users
Built with extractive labor practices
Encaptured
Closed, proprietary, patented
Surveiled, monetized
Centrally controlled
Mostly made by people of or led by pmc
Built to make money for shareholders
At best balances needs of users with cost and profitability
Not governable by users
Perversely disincentivizes switching
Attention maximizing
Opaque Magic (and thus open to fantastical interpretations)f
