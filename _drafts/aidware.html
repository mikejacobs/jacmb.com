    Computing Power

  <h4>
    Overview

      software is powerful

    <li>
      software creates and/or maintains power disparities in our society

  <h3>Software is Powerful</h3>
  <p>
    By now, we are all aware of the power of software. It organizes the world's information so it's available to query. It transmits messages across the world at the speed of light. etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    But who owns this power? Who benefits from it?
  </p>
  <h4>
    Notes
  </h4>
  <h6 class="space-mono italic">
    The current approach to building software is a recipe for creating and maintaining power disparities.
  </h6>
  <p>
    The infinite reproducibility and near universal executability of code is a double edged sword (where did this saying come from? What does it mean?). No reproduction cost and push-button, direct-to-consumer fulfillment. On the one hand, it costs next to nothing to transmit and execute code assuming you have a device that runs it. That means anyone can use a technology I create, today. This is incredible.
  </p>
  <p>
    From democratic and freedom perspective, something like open source software is an anarchist's dream. The barrier to making software is low. You can teach yourself to program with quality, freely available resources. There's ltitle cost to distribute it.  
  </p>
  <p>
    From a gatekeeping and profit seeking perspective software is a capitalists dream. Up front costs, but infinite copies. Still have maintenance costs but being closed and centrally produced, maintenance can be monetized as well. Those things coupled with monopolistic practices create a scenario ripe for lock-in and enshitification.

  <p>
    (Another example of scenario where you should apply the framing lens: Where are the boundaries? What is the framing? Who does this benefit?)

  <h4>
    Framing
  </h4>
  <p>
    In what feels like a previous life, I was a startup guy. From 2006 to 2022 I worked in just about every part of software development: founder, employee, designer, programmer, product manager. I learned of the hubris and delusion that exists in that world. Design is dishonest about it, claiming to listen to needs of software users, and make things for people. Thinking that design tools and process will always result in the best design possible is a harmful delusion, when in fact I would argue it’s the mechanism of coercion big tech uses to exploit us (turn us into attention products for advertisers or get us to work longer harder blah blah). The design process is often employed within the bounds of a business model, a nation state, and countless other ideologies. These serve as lenses that the designer may not realize exist, or are simply considered irremovable constraints/ obstacles. Either way, they are slotted into the design process as constraints. The designers job is often to make palatable to users the features that are primarily meant to coerce them or extract profits from or them.

    Lately google has gotten heat for the quality of their search (find links). What would search look like. Google is a black box. Its power comes from their ability to decide what shows up in the first page of results. I can’t make any solid claims about that goes on there other than what has been reported by others and the knowledge that search ads are 9X% of googles revenue. As a massive company beholden to quarterly shareholder pressure to increase returns, we can assume that Google is trying to squeeze every dollar out of search. The goal is not always aligned with our goals as users, and thus we get a perverse incentive for Google to sell itself to us as a neutral

  <h3>
    Collective Ownership and Development
  </h3>
  <p>
    Open source software isn’t enough. Participatory design isn't enough if the software isn't owned by the participants.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’d like to propose the idea of peoples software.
  </p>
  <p>In light of my views on abstraction. </p>
  <p>
    // Dinky
      <h4>Peoples software</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Small </li>
      <li>built to specific needs by people that need it</li>
      <li>cooperative</li>
      <li>Open, inspectable</li>
      <li>repairable </li>
      <li>knowable </li>
      <li>learnable </li>
      <li>Extendable</li>
      <li>Governable on a community scale (not through politicians)</li>
      <li>shared ownership</li>
      <li>Leaveable</li>
      <li>transparent magic </li>
    </ul>

(could write a whole post on why magic without explanation is bad, I don’t think explanations ruin good magic it makes it even better to appreciate the skill)
  </p>
  <p>
    <h4>Corporate software</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Large, monopolistic</li>
    <li>Generalized for an abstract ideal set of users</li>
    <li>Built with extractive labor practices</li>
    <li>Encaptured</li>
    <li>Shitty</li>
    <li>Closed, proprietary, patented</li>
    <li>Surveiled, monetized</li>
    <li>Centrally controlled</li>
    <li>Mostly made by people of or led by pmc</li>
    <li>Built to make money for shareholders</li>
    <li>At best balances needs of users with cost and profitability</li>
    <li>Not governable by users</li>
    <li>Perversely disincentivizes switching</li>
    <li>Attention maximizing</li>
    <li>Opaque Magic (and thus open to fantastical interpretations)</li>
  </ul>

    <h3>Software licenses</h3>
    <blockquote>software licenses are unavoidably a legal tool. the legal system, in the US and approximately everywhere else, is not a machine that leads to justice. therefore, software licenses do not lead to justice.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>we cannot software license our way to a better world. as such, we should and must software license our way to a stranger world. permissive licenses and copyleft licenses are both tools of the corporate status quo. we therefore reject all conventional software licenses, and instead champion the weird, the experimental, the decorative, the hostile, the absurd, the useless, the straight up unhinged.</blockquote>
