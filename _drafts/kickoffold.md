### New thing

I’m finding myself with a renewed sense of interest and excitement around writing and have gravitated toward doing it on social media. Not because I'm feeling the newness of BlueSky or Threads or Retro or whatever. It's clear those are simply a new version of the same old shitty software. (Why would we turn back into the well-worn cycle of tech enclosure and enshitification&mdash; it feels like we just realized we stepped on a rake and now we're about to step in the exact same place again&mdash; do you <em>really</em> think it'll be different this time?) But because Mastodon is different... I think.

Before I get too swept into the fray, I want to step back and examine these feelings, where they could lead me, and see what rakes could lie ahead. 

### What do I want?
<small>Not an exhaustive list</small>

**I want to create**. I'd like to keep a log of thought paths and creations for my future self. Get them out of my head to a place where they can be examined, refined, and shared with others. It's taken me a long time to find and understand some ideas. I want to show people there are other paths they may not have discovered yet, or have been misled away from exploring. I don't care for self-branding or -commodifying, nor do I have desire for power or prestige. This, in itself, I believe is a lesser known path these days.

**I want to participate**. I want to find others with similar interests and share our experiments, research, and strategies-- and our jokes, art, pictures of cute stuff.  

**I want freedom and safety**. Though, sadly, our society seems to be tripping on the [paradox of tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance).

**I want ownership and control.** Of my data, of the place where my data is stored, and the ways it's distributed. After decades of losing treasured data to corporate bankruptcies, failures, mergers, and fire sales, as well as having it sold to advertisers and [bad actors intent on manipulation](https://www.npr.org/2023/04/20/1170987739/facebook-settlement-lawsuit-privacy), I find it strange that we keep handing it over to new corporations optimistically (or perhaps nihilistically).

### What do I not want?

**I don't want to be surveiled or sold.** I'm tired of big corporations privatizing our private lives to lock us in. I detest their monetizing of our personal preferences and social connections. I refuse [to be the product](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvZYwaQlJsg). I refuse to be consumed. 

<aside>This may sound like personal choice. "If you don't like it, go somewhere else," you might say. The problem is, 'somewhere else' is exactly the kind of competition monopolists aggressively resist. Even now, when elsewhere exists in the form of Mastodon, [Facebook is moving in](https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/13/meta-starts-testing-threads-integration-with-activitypub/) with a rumored "embrace, extend, extinguish" strategy. I recommend [Cory Doctorow's The Internet Con:
How to Seize the Means of Computation](https://www.versobooks.com/en-gb/products/3035-the-internet-con) for more on this topic.</aside>

What do I want?

What are my fears?
Discovery. Political winds shifting and being blacklisted or cancelled for my writing for a superficial reading. Generational trauma of being discovered as a Jew and a person with political views that may not fit the mainstream. Jewish anxiety antisemitism. Attracting the wrong kind of attention generally. Perhaps I should just keep my writing to myself? Or not do it at all. 

Counter to fears 
I know I don’t want my private life privatized. I don’t want my photos or words to be owned by a company, nor do I want it to be used to advertise back to me. I worry about leaving a trail. But, I also want to show others that there are other paths they may not have considered or may have overlooked or have misled away from. I want to write. And not from a goal of self-commodifying or desire for power. Which I think in itself is a lesser known path. 
There is a kind of courage I am trying to cultivate in myself that stands up to these fears and leads me to something like being more vocal in public despite all of these fears. I have a certainty in my views that is somewhat new and I’d like to put them out there for others and have them tested (respectfully please). One of those views is that we aren’t talking enough. We let media tell us what our neighbors think in a 

I remember a dear coworker telling me once, when a conversation veered into political views, that they believed that doing making decisions for humans in the abstract was a form of violence. That stuck with me. 

In that sense, our media is facilitating violence by abstracting away from our messy humanity into bite-sized, news segment reportable identities that turn us against each other. No one can be fully represented in such a way. No nuance. We do everyone a disservice in perpetuating this practice. But I also understand the need for it. The world is supremely complex, too much for us to understand. And we seek simplification to help us wrap our heads around the events that shape our lives. 

I’m mad, I’m not going to take it anymore, and instead of fighting let’s sit down and talk in the garden.

I cycled through a number of titles in the process of writing this piece. 

Big box social media came to feel like a sanctioned "free speech" or "designated protest" zone. Even worse it was one that was advertising back to us. A playpen within corporate run world, another recuperation of our expression. A capitalist enclosure as Naomi Klein calls it in tech won’t save us or mirror world book.  Didn’t matter what it was. It’s all profitable. 

Side note: when writing this, I received a text message which struck me as a similar kind of engagement prompt found on big social media sites, and it also leads to a scam ![What are you doing?](/images/what-are-you-doing.png)

Mastodon doesn’t have this part. But it does have the quick drug-like novelty seeking loop. As I’ve engaged I’ve found my brain changing again, a social media lens/filter has crept up into the reality streaming into my brain. Would this be a good post? Should I stop what I’m doing, pull over, pause my workout, or remind myself with my phone assistant to write about a thing I just heard or thought or encountered? Or is this just the conscious recording filter that comes with an increased desire to write and interpret and connect dots in a way that they can be followed by someone else or yourself later?

I’m not trying to stay on the crest of the wave of current events or hot takes, I am just hoping to encounter people with ideas and people that are researching and exploring in a way that similar to me. This is something that I’ve had some difficulty doing in real life .

Two modes: consumption and connection. Are you simply trying to approximate and replace some social experience (para-social) or are you looking to connect and interact and participate? Does the interaction facilitate an offline one or does it replace? No judgement there. There are plenty of reasons why using online instead of offline would be preferred. 

Does my online participation deflate/ deplete my finite energy for real world interaction and work on social change? Does it 

Can this be separate from something like a personal branding exercise? Has the idea of a personal website been poisoned personal branding?
