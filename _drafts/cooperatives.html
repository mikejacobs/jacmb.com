    <h3><a id="technology">A loaded, non-trivial question</a></h3>
    <p>
        A friend recently sent me a <a href="https://twitter.com/captgouda24/status/1780345152885641350">post</a> that was doing numbers in the tech startup and economics corners of social media that I generally steer clear of these days. I don't like embedding those things so here's the initial question, paraphrasing a screenshot of an economic study:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        Why are worker’s cooperatives so rare? This is not a trivial question — because they can pay “dividends” in the form of wages, they can entirely avoid corporate income tax. They must be so inefficient by nature of their structure to outweigh their advantages.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        And a <a href="https://twitter.com/captgouda24/status/1780345158959034804">follow-up</a> with another screenshot from the study:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        The key is that, since wages are set by vote, those workers who are below average are able to redistribute from the most productive to the least. Because you have to make a [tax] contribution, it is more expensive to leave — and so incentives are distorted
    </blockquote>
<!--     <p>
        This question was followed up with a bunch of replies. From snide capitalist-pilled remarks to full on research PDFs dedicated to analyzing the incentive structure of democratically run organizations. As far as I can tell, the academic economics responses to the above question are:

    <!-- <p>
        These posts are representative of a majority view from those with money and power in the US, as well as the confusing crowd of lackeys that support them. I want to show you how this perspective entirely misses the point of worker co-ops, takes a misleading and incomplete stance on efficiency, and either purposefully or ignorantly perpetuates a harmful economics of inequity. Also, I want to take a stab at answering the initial question&mdash; worker co-ops, why so rare?&mdash; and hopefully convince you to join one in the process.

        The short answer to the question: because worker co-ops genuinely run counter to the hegemonic power structure of the US. While we sing the virtues of democracy, tout the US as a democratic country, and do all kinds of imperialism to spread it to other countries, the governance model of our corporations&mdash; the driving force of our economic power, and often the most influential governing organization for most citizen's lives&mdash; is undeniably undemocratic.<side-note>Closer to aristocratic or plutocratic.</side-note> Co-ops, especially worker co-ops, change this.

        Co-ops are operating in a hostile environment structurally, but the issues can be tracked to ideological and cultural hostility.

<!--     <p>
        Clearly this question and self-answer was just a way to shit on cooperatives, but I want to attempt to answer it because I have the same question&mdash; albeit from a very different position. First let's cut out the stilted view of the benefits of co-ops and rephrase it slightly, so we are left with a theory:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
       Worker’s cooperatives are so rare because they must be so inefficient by nature of their structure to outweigh their advantages.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        There. Co-ops are rare because they're inefficient. But wait, we need some context. What's a co-op? How rare are they? And they're inefficient at what? 
    </p> -->
    <p>Our post in focus lays out a multi-part theory in its case against worker co-ops:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Worker co-ops are rare because they're inefficient.</li>
        <li>Specifically, the "nature of their structure" is inefficient, and this is a disadvantage. (I take this as an implicit comparison to the structure of corporations.)</li>
        <li>The structure of worker co-ops allows them to democratically redistribute wages, removing the incentive for higher productivity.</li>
        <li>Highly productive workers leave for a corp where they are better appreciated (compensated).</li>
        <li>The increasingly inefficient worker co-op is unable to compete in the marketplace and fails.</li>
        <!-- <side-note>I don't disagree with the tax benefit of worker co-ops being an advantage, but I don't see it as a primary advantage, so I won't be going over that here.</side-note> -->
<!--         <li>
            Worker co-ops disincentivize and disempower the mythical highly productive workers. This individual will make less at a co-op than a corp because wages are set by vote which will inevitably pull wages down for them and elevate low-productivity wages&mdash; redistribution (gasp)!. Because they are rational actors the high-productivity workers will leave for a corp where they are better appreciated (compensated).
        </li>
        <li>
            Worker co-ops are thusly less productive. Pushing out high-productivity workers means only low-productivity workers remain, fumbling through the work like slippery sloths until the whole ship sinks.
        </li> -->
    </ul>
    <p>
        There are a few juicy bits we can sink our teeth into (and tear apart) here:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Are worker co-ops efficient?</li>
        <!-- <li>What is the structural nature of a worker co-op?</li> -->
        <li>Is the democratic nature of worker co-ops inefficient?</li>
        <li>Why do people choose to work at worker co-ops?</li>
        <li>Why do people choose to leave worker co-ops?</li>
    </ul>

        <summary><h4>What is a worker cooperative?</h4></summary>
        <blockquote>
            A cooperative is an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned and democratically-controlled enterprise.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Our theory in question focuses on worker co-ops: a co-op owned by some or all of its workers. They are often seen as an idealistic alternative business entity to a corporation. In contrast to a typical S- or C-corp, whose goals and values in practice often simply boil down to "maximize shareholder value", a cooperative is guided by seven principles:

            Where's the eighth principle: do all of the above as efficiently as possible?

        <summary><h4>Are co-ops rare?</h4></summary>
        <p>
            According to the <a href="https://democracy.institute.coop/2021-worker-cooperative-state-sector-report">2021 Worker Cooperative State of the Sector Report</a> from the Democracy at Work Institute:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>There are ~1,000 worker cooperatives in the US economy</li>
            <li>Employing ~10,000 workers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            LLCs, S- and C-Corporation numbers are in the millions. So, yes, worker co-ops are rare.

<!--     <p>
        In the religiosity of capitalism, economists are the priests. Economists <b>love</b> to analyze how effective businesses are at turning money and labor into profit. I am not an economist. Ok, we can do that. So, if you increase your input (through increasing worker productivity or lowering spend on wages), then you get more of the output (profit), correct? This works only to a certain point though. After that, the people doing your labor start to break down. A key element here is that the person pushing for productivity the owner of the business, or someone hired to enforce their interests. Especially considering none of the benefit of profit-maxxing goes to them. Then, finding more profit turns into a brutal game of manipulation:
    </p> -->
    <p>
        When an capitalist economist talks about efficiency, they are implicitly framing the conversation within the bounds of capitalism. A system that notoriously wealth with virtue.
    </p>
    <p>
        Absolutely, worker co-ops are inefficient when compared to a corporation functioning in our economy... an economy that not only structurally favors corporations,<side-note>More on this later</side-note> but is overrun with backdealing and monopoly tactics that buy politicians and regulators to ensure their continued success. Is that the kind of efficiency we're talking about?

        <i class="space-mono italic" style="background: lightcoral; color: white; font-size: 18px;line-height: 28px">How much can we squeeze out of workers, while not sharing the juicy spoils, before they leave or revolt, oversqueezed? And what if we squeeze them just barely less than that for now, but try testing that boundary again next quarter when the workers might be more desperate and squeezable due to the measures we took to make sure that happens?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        We all know this game. We're on the losing end of it perpetually. It is a cold, short-sighted trap that leads to us being treated as expendable machines. That's how things have been done in the US, quarter by quarter, since the 70s. It's how we got a graph like this: 
    </p>
    <p>
        <side-note numberless>
            The difference between the two lines contributes to profit— which is increasing at a wild rate! Over time, every hour worked produces more money for shareholders than the last hour, while paying the worker basically the same.
        </side-note>
        <a href="/images/productivity-v-wages.png"><img class="full" src="/images/productivity-v-wages.png"></a></p>
    <p>
        And this is just one graph, one way of squeezing us. The economists keep coming up with novel squeezing methods all the time. They have a word for this: incentives. Which we really need to call by its real name: coersion. Here are just a few coersive methods that are currently used at various levels of the economy to ensure we stay desperately employed and without power in our work:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Tying health insurance to work</li>
        <li>Unforgiving, artificially inflated cost of living</li>
        <li>Extreme resistence to unionizing</li>
        <li>Interest rate hikes</li>
        <li>Unclear costs in gig work</li>
        <li>A lack of social safety net</li>
        <li>The brutality and criminalization of homelessness</li>
    </ul>
<!--     <p>
        Don't get me wrong, doing things efficiently is a priority at a worker co-op, but it is by no means the top one. You might argue that efficiency is a key component in competitive fitness and survival. My friend, that is a Darwinian perspective to which there is already a fantastic counter from <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-prince-of-evolution-peter-kropotkin/">Kropotkin</a>: mutual aid and cooperation are the reasons for the success of humankind. 
    </p> -->
    <h4>Cui bono?</h4>
    <p>
        So when I hear words like "efficiency", I ask: who benefits? who loses? and to what end? Corporations run on the exploitation mentioned above. Not as a byproduct, disparities in pay and power are central components of their innerworkings. The driving forces for work in this context are subjugation and coersion. Leading to a workplace filled with fear, uncertainty, apathy, and boredom. Whereas the co-op principles are decidedly human-centered. Inclusion, democracy, independence, accessibility, participation, autonomy, interdependence, community well-being. When work is no longer exploitative, when profit-maxxing is no longer the goal, work can be very different. It feels different to the workers. That's not to say some of these things can't be found in corporate workplaces, but in a worker co-op they are part of the mission. Focusing solely on the output, the efficiency, misses the real difference in quality of life&mdash; something economics is woefully inept at prioritizing or even measuring. 
    </p>
    <p>
        These assholes don't want people working at co-ops because it erodes their power.
    </p>
    <p>
        A worker co-op is going to be more needs-based in its approach to compensation. One of the cooperatives I worked for set all full-time employee salaries at the same level, regardless of title, age, or experience. There were a few exceptions though. One worker's mother became ill and they suddenly had to support her financially. The culture was caring in such a way that this person felt comfortable bringing up the issue and the co-op voted to give them a raise.


        <!-- Pitting co-ops against corps in a system that favors corps and then declaring that co-ops don't work is not a true comparison. Also, the goals of organizations are often different. -->
    </p>
    <p>
        My own story in co-ops aligns exactly with the highly productive worker that our quote above portends to defend.
        It's worth noting that my position at this co-op, which did have some levels of hierarchy, was in a high-level managerial role overseeing a department. 
    </p>
    
<!--     <p>
        Efficiency for whom? More profits for whom? Also, there's an implicit comparison in there&mdash; worker co-ops vs. corps&mdash; and it belies a failure to understand the operating environment of the organizations. Absolutely, worker co-ops are inefficient when compared to a corporation functioning in our economy... an economy that not only structurally favors corporations, but is overrun with backdealing and monopoly tactics that bend politicians and regulators to ensure their continued success. Is that the kind of efficiency we're talking about?
    </p> -->
    <p>
        
    </p>
    <h4>Why would anyone want to work at a worker co-op? Why would high-productivity workers want to?</h4>
    <p>
        The bounds of this argument are absurd.
    </p>
    <p>
        We have already established that productivity-maxxing is not the top priority of a worker cooperative. So, if a worker happened to be highly productive and felt they should be compensated more. That would be a misunderstanding of the goals of the co-op?   
    </p>
<!--     <p>
        Economists also love incentives&mdash; which we really need to call by their real name: coersion. Why would we want to do anything other than the most productive, most profitable action? Why wouldn't I, as a worker, want to receive the most compensation possible for my productivity? 
    </p> -->

And what if we squeeze them just barely less than that for now, but try testing that boundary again next quarter when the workers might be more desperate? Squeeeeal!</i> That is a cold, short-sighted trap that leads us to treat humans as machines until we can replace them with machines.

    <p>
        The co-op principles are decidedly human-centered. Inclusion, democracy, independence, accessibility, participation, autonomy, sharing, community well-being... aren't these things worth more than even more profit?
    </p>
<!--     <p>
        This re-focusing on the people over profit is what leads co-ops to be more likely to weather economic downturns [see DWI report]. In my view it's also what makes them a key ingredient to a better world. But it's also very much counter to the quarterly profit cycle our economy runs on. 
    </p> -->
<!--     <p>
        The above-mentioned report contains a poll of worker co-ops to identify challenges their workpaces face. As my own experience working in a cooperative would lead me to guess, one of the top challenges is "financing growth".

    <p>
        So why would I, a high productivity worker want to work at a co-op?

        So, if employee-owners are more productive, but, according to our quote worker-cooperatives are not, what's the difference? Democracy. Power. Control.
    </p>
    <p>
        Better workers are incentivized to leave not because co-ops don't work, but because our economies are positioned against cooperatives. 
        It's a failure in understanding the operating environment of the organizations. Pitting co-ops against corps in a system that favors corps and then declaring that co-ops don't work is not a true comparison. Also, the goals of organizations are often different. It's like saying non-profits don't work when compared to corps. Well, sure a corp might be more productive and generate more profit and growth, but that isn't the goal of the non-profit so why does it matter?

        The economist sees the corporate workplace as one of benevolent meritocracy. The genius bosses overseeing the workers are deserving of their outsized ownership and rewards. The workers are lucky to have a job with their boss, as it grants them permission to live in society. Maybe they'll learn a thing or two, and a few exceptional underlings will nose-grindstone nose their grindstone their way to the boss chair in the future.

        In a world where money gives you access to food, shelter, clothing, healthcare, and all sorts of other wonderful things and experiences&mdash; effectively your ability to exist &mdash;working for anything less than your maximum wage would not make sense. It would be irrational! How else would you live?
    </p>
    <p>
        I would argue that view, for the average person, is a risky position to take. Sure, a small minority become moneyed gods. But if it's on you to accrue, then it's on you if you don't. Rolled a disability? Slipped on an addiction? Email scammer (another symptom of capitalist greed) got your savings? What if I told you there is a different path to those things you need and want? The Interdependence.

        Have these people ever worked as a high-productivity individual in a profit-maxxing corporation? Sure, you can make a multiplier on your salary. Cadillac health insurance is a sweet ride, espeically for a grabbag of maladies like myself. Sure looks great from that perspective. But none of that accounts for the lived experience as a piddling resource, a lowly node on the org chart. The chart whose upper peaks teem with sleezoids and wannabe dictators, whose middle ranks are back stabbing body climbers. <side-note>And that's just internally, the corpo sum-of-its-parts legally-people in the world is a <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2010/12/invaders-from-mars.html">sociopathic alien intelligence</a> that is tearing our world apart. </side-note>

        Economics is terrible at accounting for these things: happiness, sense of purpose, empowerment, satisfaction, nature, "externalities". Not everything is about productivity and growth. Growth in the wrong way can be harmful. When this happens in our body, we call it cancer. Economics is a science in the same way basketball is maths. basketball commentary is a sport. In the end it's trying to rationalize and systematize a complex game that runs on human ability and feelings.

        The sad reality is that people still live in a world where money is still their key to freedom. My broad criticism of economics is that not everything is about productivity. We have seen this blind adherence to profit maximizing destroy our world. 

        It generates more profit to generate a cheap thing and deal with the reprocutions than to focus on quality. Knock-off tourniquets on Amazon selling for $2 a pop with a high failure rate (failure in this context often means death of the person wearing the device). 

        People are not rational actors as economics sees them. And within that I stick out as a non-rational actor.

        As a high-productivity individual, is it irrational to say that I'd rather prioritize happiness, positive impact, and mutual assured survival for my community over salary-maxxing? 
<br><br>
        Am I irrational for wanting to work without declaring dictatorial control and extracting value from my colleagues? Instead of building a moat and competing with the business down the street, wouldn't it be rational to build interdependence, share knowledge and resources, and make decisions democratically?

        According to <a href="https://www.nceo.org/article/key-studies-employee-ownership-and-corporate-performance" target="_blank">numerous academic studies</a>, companies where at least 30% of the shares are owned by a broad-based group of employees, where all employees have access to ownership, and where the concentration of ownership is limited are <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228248987_The_ESOP_Performance_Puzzle_in_Public_Companies" target="_blank">more productive</a>, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286471693_Firm_Survival_and_Performance_in_Privately_Held_ESOP_Companies" target="_blank">grow faster</a>, and are <a href="https://research.upjohn.org/up_press/241/" target="_blank">less likely to go out of business</a> than their counterparts. According to recent research by the <a href="https://www.ownershipeconomy.org/" target="_blank">National Center for Employee Ownership</a>, employee-owners have higher wages and net worths, receive better benefits, and are less likely to lose jobs to cuts and outsourcing during a downturn, compared with workers who don’t have ownership stakes in their organizations.
