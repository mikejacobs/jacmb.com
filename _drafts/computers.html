The reality of computers is a fascinating illusion. Millions of little calculations happing at orders of magnitude faster than our perseption  adding up to an experience that is basically magic. This idea entranced me at a young age, much like many folks I have encountered that work(ed)in technology over the years. Then I found programming. First HTML, then Java, then Javascript, then others. 

Felt powerful/godlike in creating little recipes that the computer would follow. And putting them out into the world. It transformed my thought. I could describe something like drawing a line or making a sound or organizing information in a level of detail that I didn't know existed-- and so very specific to the way a computer thinks, of course-- as if I was talking to an alien visiting from another dimension that didn't have any of our evolved, innate knowledge of our reality and how to interact with it. 

Basically, every time you boot up a computer it is reborn. It has to rebuild its mind and relearn how to interpret its sensory input from ours. Worse than a newborn in that it has almost no innate knowledge other than what we've baked into its circuitry, but, crucially, it has near infinite time to do this relearning these things as needed. 

From this direction, it's almost a psychedelic experience. As if, through the computer, we gained access to the machine elves dimension, where they do work for us outside of time and present the results on the screen.

<!-- With the advent of the internet and the web, the metaphor of intradimensional travel has  -->

But this alien isn't here on its own self-guided adventure in our dimension. It is here for us as a portal into its dimension. 

Incredible things have happen and continue to happen in this dimension:

hyjinx
exploration
creativity

Emergence of whole new categories of ways to extend our abilites; new ideas, new ways to work, new ways to interact with each other... a huge list of things that have changed what it means to be a human.

		Another Reality

On the other hand, the fascinating reality of computers is one that I (and likely many others) struggle to keep at arms length. I have a few ideas for why that could be.

I have come to see computers as portals into another dimension. One that ultimately distracts and detracts from our involvement in this one. 

By limiting our interaction to the 

The way this has crashed into our reality has created a rift. 

<!-- The alien is a submarine for us.  -->


<h4>Our senses are limited.</h4>
Interacting through mechanical devices.
We stare out into this dimension as if through a porthole, piloting a submarine in the deep ocean or a ship in cyberspace. 

<h4>Our body is barely used</h4>
But, different from these experiences, a crucial sense is entirely cutoff: bodily awareness. At least in a spacecraft, you are aware of your body in a tiny vessel and add that to the mental calculations of your movements. The result is great care because a tiny mistake could end your life. 

Our explorations in cyberspace are almost entirely divorced from our physical existence. Our fingers twich on keyboards, mice, and touch screens. 

<h4>Abstraction</h4>
Windows that overlap with fake depth, buttons that don't exist, nested file systems and libraries that all have their own allusions to the real world -- which makes them valuable metaphors for learning computer interactions -- I suspect, in their not-realness all have a side effect of further creating a distinctive dimension within the computer that is separate from our own.

Adding that to the flattening of global-scale social commities into a document-like browser window, devoid of any kind of spaciality, or body language, that exists on the same computer-interaction-scale as this browser window. Holy sheez that's asking a lot for a brain that's accustomed to all of those things to 

<h4>Harmful Context Switching</h4>

But we come to computing with our real world mental models, sensory feedback, and fuller social cues.

This adjacent dimension I am describing is one where we jump in and out of throughout our day. This sort of context-switching is difficult, for me and others I have talked to.

Any time you have to thoughtfully interact with a screen-- whoosh!

The reality of computing 
Bodily laziness
Another dimension
Abstract
Real world seems like a chore
Different modalities
No sensory experience
Mediated through sensors

		Refocus on Our Reality

But this is all not to say we should throw it out

Moreso, I make a case for moving computers futher into our world. Create ways of interacting with it that are more like interacting with our reality. 

Disintermediation? Might be only a finance word

Programming more like cooking
