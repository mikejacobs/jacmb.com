		I sit down and press the power button. Over the next few seconds, the device, which in its off state exists as a cold skeleton, is reborn into our world. It rediscovers its physical parts, relearns how to interpret sensory input, then reassembles its knowledge. Even more helpless than a newborn in that it has almost no innate knowledge other than the function of its parts determined by physics and a minimal ignition system to kickstart this whole process. But, crucially, once all the physical components are powered up and humming together, its sense of time is orders of magnitude more granular than mine. It has near-infinite time to do this relearning. Entire libraries flipped through in a matter of seconds. It happens before I am even comfortably situated in front of it. Then, the process is complete, and it has returned to its running state: a wonder of the universe in its capabilities available to me as a portal into another dimension.

	<h3>Personal Computing Problem</h3>
	<pre>
The web and I grew up together. 80s kids with an awkward period in the 90s, we've had many years of fun bouncing around markup, sheets, and scripts. Collecting links and building connections. As with any friendship that lasts long enough, some patterns have emerged over the years. [This is the tone for the rest of the piece.] And one that sticks out is a struggle to divide my attention between the reality that exists within the web (and its portal to our world, the computer) and the reality outside it.

<h3>Spiritual Problem</h3>
	<pre>
In this dimension, there is little spiritual*<span class="sidenote">* </span> connection to this work. In fact, the sense of god-like control that we have in the computing dimension has crept into our world. We now see the messiness of this world as a problem to tame with computers. We spread the sensors and extend the mechanisms. The machines put people out of work-- a function of them existing within capitalism-- 

Conjure Utopia makes a great case against the spiritually empty path technology has taken us down. It's one without a future for us and our world. One where we are conquerers of nature and we are more concerned with what a technology does than who it does it for and how it affects our world. A classic reframing. 

That way lies <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus">a rock and an eagle coming for our liver</a>. 

Tomorrow belongs to the Spiritual Cyborg
https://write.as/conjure-utopia/tomorrow-belongs-to-the-spiritual-cyborg

<blockquote>Surrendering to these higher forces allows us to come to terms with our limits, but also embrace our oneness with one another, with the external environment, with other biological and non-biological processes, being connected and whole with the totality of what surrounds us. This is in direct opposition to the Gnosticism of Silicon Valley: we cannot be separate from our environment, and our mind cannot be separate from the body. We are what we are only in the here and now. We are defined by our context. Thereâ€™s no core, no independent self. There's no mind uploading, no AGI, no egocentric mind empowerment.

	<h3>Awe and Nostalgia</h3>
	<pre>
The reality of computers is a compelling illusion. Millions of little calculations happening at orders of magnitude faster than our perception adding up to an experience that is basically magic. This idea entranced me at a young age, much like many folks I have encountered that work(ed)in technology over the years. Then I found programming. First HTML, then Java, then JavaScript, then others. 

Felt powerful/godlike in creating little recipes that the computer would follow. And putting them out into the world. It transformed my thought. I could describe something like drawing a line or making a sound or organizing information in a level of detail that I didn't know existed-- and so very specific to the way a computer thinks, of course-- as if I was talking to an alien visiting from another dimension that didn't have any of our evolved, innate knowledge of our reality and how to interact with it. 

Basically, every time you boot up a computer it is reborn. It has to reassemble its knowledge, rediscover its physical parts, and relearn how to interpret its sensory input from our world. Even more helpless than a newborn in that it has almost no innate knowledge other than the little we've baked into its circuitry, but, crucially, once all the physical components are powered up, it has near-infinite time to do this relearning. 

As a kid that grew up in a chaotic household, this predictability was an appealing thing.


Magic Ink



From this direction, it's almost a psychedelic experience. As if, through the computer, we gained access to the machine elves dimension, where they do work for us outside of time and present the results on the screen.

<!-- With the advent of the internet and the web, the metaphor of intradimensional travel has  -->

But this alien isn't here on its own self-guided adventure in our dimension. It is here for us as a portal into its dimension. 

Incredible things have happen and continue to happen in this dimension:

hyjinx
exploration
creativity

Emergence of whole new categories of ways to extend our abilities; new ideas, new art, new ways to interact with each other... a huge list of things that have changed what it means to be a human.

I'd like to argue that, while computers have done incredible things for us, they have created a rift in our reality. Software eating our world means our world becomes more focused on and mediated by software, and things that do not translate well into software get neglected and left behind.<span class="callout">&midast;</span><span class="sidenote"><span class="callout">&midast;</span>This is not a new phenomenon. I believe distancing from our local reality began with the advent of the automobile. Little bubbles that take us somewhere else. We still have to drive through the other places, but often at such a speed that we don't internalize them. Looking at the difference between cities designed before and after the automobile, it's easy to see how profoundly it altered our world. A topic covered extensively by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0intLFzLaudFG-xAvUEO-A">Not Just Bikes</a>.</span>

In a similar way that an automobile isolates you,

	<h3>
		Another Reality
	</h3>
	<pre>
On the other hand, the fascinating reality of computers is one that I (and likely many others) struggle to keep at arms length. I have a few ideas for why that could be. 

I have come to see computers as portals into another dimension. One that ultimately distracts and detracts from our involvement in this one. 

Sitting down to use a computer (or similar device) means conforming to its reality; one of virtual representation and interaction mediated by input devices.

By limiting our interaction to the 

The way this has crashed into our reality has created a rift. 

<!-- The alien is a submarine for us.  -->


<h4>Our senses are limited.</h4>
Interacting through mechanical devices.
We stare out into this dimension as if through a porthole, piloting a submarine in the deep ocean or a ship in cyberspace. We cannot touch the objects in this world to assess their physical properties, we cannot smell them, or establish a proprioceptive feedback loop beyond the limits of the keyboard/mouse/touch screen. And someone who has done sound design in software, I know sound is mostly an afterthought if considered at all. 

<h6 class="space-mono italic">Our bodies are barely used</h6>
At least in a spacecraft, you are aware of your body in a tiny vessel and add that to the mental calculations of your movements. The result is great care because a tiny mistake could end your life. While I'm not pushing for a life-threatening edge to our computer use, we're almost at the other extreme. Our explorations in cyberspace are mostly divorced from our physical existence. Fingers twitch on mice, clack on keyboards, wiggle and drum on touch screens. While minimal physical requirements are great for maximum accessibility, keeping everyone at that minimum all of the time, with no option for more, is a path to physical issues associated with a sedentary lifestyle. Jobplaces that required long hours on a computer were rife with repetitive stress injuries in our hands and awful degenerative back and neck problems-- one physical therapist in the Bay Area called it a "tech neck epidemic". 

All of this is a massive design shortcoming. We have built computers so we have to strain ourselves to meet their input requirements. 

<h6 class="space-mono italic">Computers need to meet us where we are, and work with the way our bodies work &mdash; not the other way around.</h6>

Virtual reality, with its 3D physical tracking, seems to finally begin to address this problem until you consider that, at the same time, it further confines computing to a private experience and blocks out the world. Which brings us to the next big issue...

/ or /

its further separates us from the world by sending us into a valley of metaphor  

<h4>Social Signal Loss</h4>

Adding to the abstraction: flattening of global-scale social communities, with complex social interactions, into a document-like browser window, devoid of any kind of spaciality or body language, that exists on the same information-presentation scale as this post. There is little difference in computing experience between a window for interacting with a friend group vs a sports stadium full vs a whole country's worth of people. 

So we have to hold this in our head and holy shit that's asking a lot for a brain that's accustomed to all of those things. Personally, I have always felt that text-only chatting or posting to an audience of strangers doesn't carry enough context-- it requires an uncomfortable sanding down of my human corners in order to shove them through a text box. Instead of the "democratizing" that is intended, I feel we are all being truncated.

What's especially difficult is the web often sells itself as a third place, but due to its non-spaciality it only succeeds in creating a place in an adjacent dimension that /seemingly/ meets our needs, but in fact is not a replacement, and ends up preventing us from meeting those needs in this world. This is where critical social interactions occur: community building, solidarity

There are notable exceptions to these drawbacks. I do not feel this signal loss in social interactions through cyberspace that have roots in our world. The group chat for the community center garden working group is a great example. Most of the conversation is centered around coordination, planning, and building group cohesion for the in-person work we do on a weekly basis. There are still moments of tone ambiguity and disagreement, but we are quick to eject from the text chat and continue it in person, always with much greater ease and success.

<h4>Abstraction</h4>

Software effectively transcends space. It's core to its touted magic, and less examined, key to our difficulty with it.

Windows that overlap with fake depth, buttons that don't push, nested file systems and libraries that all have their own allusions to the real world -- which makes them valuable metaphors for learning computer interactions -- I suspect, in their not-realness all have a side effect of further creating a distinctive dimension within the computer that is separate from our own. People exist in there, we know, but I believe the result is a bifurcation of our sense of reality and how we can act in it. Computer interaction that is not rooted in the real world, whether it be socially or physically, gives the illusion of action on those fronts. Acting on the computer gives the feeling that one has acted in the real world. Cleaning up my file system can give me a sense that things are neat and tidy when in reality, my house is still a mess.

<h4>Harmful Context Switching</h4>

But we come to computing with our real world mental models, sensory feedback, and fuller social cues.

This adjacent dimension I am describing is one where we jump in and out of throughout our day. This sort of context-switching is difficult, for me and others I have talked to.

Any time you have to thoughtfully interact with a screen-- whoosh! 

(xistenz?)


<h4>Control Creep or Seeing Like a Computer</h4>

For the programmer, there is an added risk in this dimensional bifurcation. Mastering control of the machine that creates this reality can result in something I'll call programmability creep: the sense that our reality can also be programmed. I believe this is where there is exceptional potential for harm. Approaching our beautifully squishy soft messy human world like a rigid, predictable, programmable computer environment is a top down visionary hubris that leads to real pain for real humans. Taking computers out of the realm of neutral, hammer-like tools that extend our capabilities, and into the uncharted territory of decision-makers with real world consequence. Terrifying!

We desperately want to abdicate difficult decision-making to machines. I believe this is an unrealized admission of the impossibility of dictating the lives of others in a top-down manner that . From this perspective, the messiness needs to be cleaned up so we can reduce complexity and manage human society as we would a machine. Or we need to build AI to manage the machine that is too complex for us to ever understand. But the world is only overwhelmingly complex if you are trying to control it! The messiness <em>is</em> life. Give up the desire to control. Admit that we can't and <em>should not</em> do it. If we do people will inevitably fall through the cracks because they don't fit neatly in available categories or decision trees. That road leads to violence by algorithmic oversight or death by bug. States already fail to do this on a bureaucratic level with some human intervention. AI will fail even harder.

Seeing Like a State's Scientific Forestry parable (https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/first/s/scott-state.html)


Reality is messy. Humans have wildly different needs and desires as many as their are different combinations of culture, location, sexuality. What is a system that can account for all the different needs and desires?

Trickle Down Reality 

<blockquote>Technology is just a means to facilitate the awareness of our limits and of our interdependence with each other. Thus, technology shall become the means to empower us through inter-reliance, dissolving egos in the process rather than individualizing us and forcing us to live in the guise of the man-child that today dominates the growth of technology, trying to replace their subservient mothers with a piece of software.

They promised us that by wielding technology, we would become Gods. They enslaved us by either making us click on ads or making us work weekends to force people to click on ads.</blockquote>

		Refocus on Our Human Reality
	</h3>
	<pre>

But this is all not to say we should throw it out.

Moreso, I make a case for moving computers futher into our world. Create ways of interacting with it that are more like interacting with our reality. And diminishing their role to supportive scenarios. Like many proposals for alternative realities, it's hard to visualize what this would look like. But, in the vein of making the road by walking it, we can prefigure the means and decision-making that can help us find the future.

Disintermediation? Might be only a finance word


<h3>Toward a Local Computing</h3>

Programming more like cooking.
Communities based in real life. 


Make software that encourages autonomy and independence. 

Instead of centralized and global scale, what does a local software look like? How could computers enhance the lived reality of places and help build interdependence with neighbors?

Instead of maximizing attention on the web, how can we design software to encourage and facilitate in-person interactions? Where can the software graciously step back instead of asserting itself and its creators' goals?
