	<h3>The Highly Productive Worker</h3>
	<p>
		In trying to answer the question, "where are all the worker cooperatives?", I sometimes find myself with a printed out economics <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w6118/w6118.pdf">research paper</a>, scribbling notes in the margins. In those pages, I keep running into a persona: the highly productive worker (HPW).
	</p>
	<p>
		HPWs are revered in the economics world. They are the standout, the dedicated model worker on which a business owner relies. They are distinct from founders/owners in that they don't call the shots, but they are the cream that should be allowed to meritocratically rise to the top of an org chart and/or pay ladder. In startup world we know this person as a 10x developer/designer/whatever or a <a href="https://paulgraham.com/gh.html">great hacker</a>. A subject of much mythologizing.
	</p>
	<p>
		
	</p>
	<p>
		I am often seeing the HPW used defensively. 
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		"...high-ability cooperative members can credibly threaten to leave the firm if there is too much redistribution."
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		There is a distinct flavor of exceptionalist justice in these scenarios: some people are just better than others and they should be rewarded for that. It should be acknowledged that this is the prespective of an employer. The other side of this, the 
	</p>
	<p>
    	In what feels like a previous life, I was a startup guy. From 2006 to 2022 I worked in just about every part of software development: founder, employee, designer, programmer, product manager. All the hats. And I made things that were used by millions of people and made bajillions of dollars for my employers. It would be something to be proud of if it wasn't for the hubris and delusion that exists in that world. 
  	</p>
	<p>
		As with many things meritocratic, I think it is a mistake to think of HPW as a consequence of capitalism. What if HPWs are standouts because of capitalism? The workers that manage to thrive in the given system, overcome the brutality and perservere. I'm willing to bet if there was more opportunity for workers to find their optimal role, had more needs met, arrived at work with less stress from living precariously, and did not have to grapple with the alienation from their labor, we would see more HPWs.
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		Each worker's (observable) output depends on ability and on effort, neither of which can be observed separately.
	</blockquote>
	<!-- Economics is fascinating to me. often attempting to explain and mathematize a system that is ultimately a vibes-based hyperobject -->
	<p>
		Economists see the corporate workplace as one of benevolent meritocracy. The genius bosses overseeing the workers are deserving of their outsized ownership and rewards. The workers are lucky to have a job with their boss, as it grants them permission to live in society. Maybe they'll learn a thing or two, and a few exceptional underlings will nose-grindstone nose their grindstone their way to the boss chair in the future.
	</p>
	<p>
		As a high-productivity individual, is it irrational to say that I'd rather prioritize happiness, positive impact, and mutual assured survival for my community over salary-maxxing?
	</p>
	<p>
		Am I irrational for wanting to work without declaring dictatorial control and extracting value from my colleagues? Instead of building a moat and competing with the business down the street, wouldn't it be rational to build interdependence, share knowledge and resources, and make decisions democratically?
