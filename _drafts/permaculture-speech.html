	<top-note>This is a speech given at the end of the Sonoran Permaculture Guild's Spring 2022 class</top-note>
	<p>Thank you for this. I’m honored to have been selected to give this speech to such a curious and creative bunch of people. I want to congratulate us: we’re now permaculturists and food foresters and land relationship councilors. I know you’re as excited as I am about taking these design tools out in to the world.</p>
	<p>From my own experience, a design education is a perspective changing event. It’s a set of glasses that shift your relationship to the world and, once you put them on, you can’t take them off. You will never see the human-shaped environment the same way again. From now on, you won’t be able to drive past an elementary school and not think of the amazing things they’re doing at Manzo Elementary, or see a stretch of saguaro as anything other than a farm, and I know I’ll never look at a firehouse the same way again (Brett, I hope you’ll send out photos of your project so those in the other presentation group can see it).</p>
	<p>If you’re not careful, it may begin to haunt you. But, instead of getting bogged down by all of the problems we see… do the permaculture inversion: all around us are opportunities to bring about real positive change and realign humanity with nature.</p>
	<p>My background is in a different kind of design— user experience design— which is a jargony term for “person who figures out what people need out of software and then designs that software”. On the face of it, it doesn’t sound too different from permaculture design— just for software. I got into this line of work because I loved making things with computers and wanted to have a hand in bringing about the techno utopian future where computers solved all our problems.</p>
	<p>It took me a long time to realize that most of our problems did not come from a lack of computers or a lack of sophistication in software, they come from a lack of care— our problems are social problems. Not only that, but in my role as “person who figures out what people need out of software”— the “people” were not who I expected: they were the people that owned the software. Not the people meant to use it.</p>
	<p>It was my job to figure out how to find a path, through the creation of software, to get the users to do what the owners wanted. The needs of the people using the software were second… often a distant second… sometimes only enough to get them to do something that then led to profitability.</p>
	<p>In my 15 years in this industry, this was the prevailing role of design in technology. But it isn’t just a tech problem, we have all been at the wrong end of these perverse incentives in various aspects of our lives— it’s the reason we feel like we’re being swindled every time we go looking for something to meet a legitimate need.</p>
	<p>I tell you this because I think it serves as a good example of how designing and building things can work against us as humans in nature if we don’t ask some key questions about who we are building for and why.</p>
	<p>In contrast, the design process of permaculture begins with those questions: “who we are building for and why”. Personally, I was drawn to permaculture because it has a solid set of ethics that are rooted in care.</p>
	<p>But solid <em>ethics</em> are only a starting point. In practice they can be abstract and difficult to apply to specific situations. Thankfully, Dan and company taught us a set of tools, like the de-/re-/generative framework and the permaculture principles to analyze our design decisions— because what really matters is how these ethics meet the real world– the actions we take and the affects they have on the world around us.</p>
	<p>Thank you Dan for patiently teaching us these things, and showing us how they can be applied beyond the context of agriculture to the wider world and the invisible structures that govern it currently.</p>
	<p>I know most of us are excited to get our projects off the ground… or into the ground really. Down from the foam board and into the rain gutter. To transform our zones into perma-oases of regenerative practice and harmony with nature. I know I can’t wait to finally dig a network of trenches and basins in my yard. But I urge you to not stop there.</p>
	<p>We now have a valuable skill with which we can further reinforce our community interdependence. Bring these ideas to your communities, and offer your skills, respectfully, to other communities in a way that minimizes the preventative screens, like cost. We all benefit from permaculture practices being implemented on a larger scale, and being applied to all our invisible structures.</p>
	<p>I leave you with a relevant quote from one of my favorite authors, David Graeber, anthropologist and prominent anarchist who died early in the pandemic, in his book The Utopia of Rules he says:</p>
	<p>“the ultimate, hidden truth of the world is that it is something that we make, and could just as easily make differently […] the hidden reality of human life is the fact that the world doesn’t just happen. It isn’t a natural fact, even though we tend to treat it as if it is—it exists because we all collectively produce it.”</p>
	<p>Thank you.</p>
