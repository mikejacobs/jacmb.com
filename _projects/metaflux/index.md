About the show:

meta (a) pertaining to or noting an abstract, high-level analysis or commentary, especially one that consciously references something of its own type.

flux (n) continuous change, passage, or movement

Framing understanding through routines and systems, Metaflux is a body of procedure-oriented artworks based on system-focused approaches and integrations. The processes examined by the artists featured in Metaflux are intrinsic to navigating shifts and changes by establishing routines and frameworks. The artifacts of these personal frameworks, as well as the frameworks themselves, represent the efforts to create reliable variables and constructs in a life defined by constant transition and flux.
