<!-- <h4> A little bit about the project:</h4> -->
<p> 
This project uses the <a href="https://github.com/algorithmic-music-exploration/amen">Amen library</a> to rip apart songs and piece them back together again using a two-tiered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system">Lindenmayer system</a> for composition: one for beats, another for song structure.

  An interesting line of exploration developed in my solo music a few years ago. I found myself in Ableton Live slicing up other artists' songs into slivers of sound &mdash; often only long enough to get a single drum hit &mdash; and then rearranging them to form beats and musical phrases. Here's a short example:

  The main ingredient in that example is: Peter John and Bjorn's Let's Call It Off<br><br>

  </p>

  My intent was to sample just the (impecible) drum hits from this song. But, without access to the original, isolated drum recording, any attempt to extract them left me with other bits of song: vocals, guitars, bass. ("try to pull a noodle from the spaghetti and you're gonna get some sauce"). A frustration at first. But, after piecing together a beat, I came to realize that the sauce made things more interesting.

  After using this technique a few times in songs, and enjoying the results, I figured this was the sort of thing that would be better done with the aid of code. I found the <a href="https://github.com/algorithmic-music-exploration/amen">Amen library</a>, which does a great job
  of doing the slicing. It quickly finds "hits" in the song, and gives you a nice set of code tools for remixing.
