	<p>
		Based on <a href="https://sugarfreelondoner.com/sugar-free-orange-marmalade-recipe-keto/#h-how-to-make-keto-orange-marmalade">this recipe</a> but I made some changes, notably leaving out all sweeteners (real or replacement)
	</p>
	<p>Makes enough to can 5 x 4 oz mason jars. I usually make a double batch.</p>

	<p>Ingredients</p>
	<ul>
		<li>2 lb oranges</li>
		<li>1 cup of fresh orange juice</li>
		<li>2 cups water</li>
		<li>1/4 tsp cinnamon </li>
		<li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
		<li>Splash of vanilla</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Instructions</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Peel, remove seeds, and then mash half of the oranges. Make sure to leave the pith (this provides pectin for gumminess). </li>
		<li>For the other half, leave the peel on, remove seeds, and then slice very thinly (I used a food processor). The peel can be too bitter for some people’s taste. For less bitterness, peel more of the </li>oranges. 
		<li>Add all ingredients to pot
			Heat to boil and then simmer with top for 2 hours
		Turn to medium and remove lid, cook for 30 min while stirring —frequently toward the end to avoid burning </li>
	</ul>
