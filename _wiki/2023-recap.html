    <summary>Took a permaculture design class specific to the Sonoran desert.</summary>
    <p>
      The wholistic, long term thinking of permaculture is so essential to nurturing our desert
      environment. And the practices are different from other biomes, given that water is scarce most
      of the time, and overwhelmingly abundant for short periods (intense summer monsoons and
      sometimes winter rains). This class helped me better understand how to “plant the rain”
      (beneficial terraforming for rain capture and use); design for passive heating and cooling
      (shade is so so important here); and nurture symbiotic, closed-loop, native food-producing plant
      systems. It was possibly the most unique and special education experiences of my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, I was left with two bad tastes: 1. I wish there had been a deeper integration and
      acknowledgement of the indigenous practices that were the source of information for the class.
      Absent of that, it felt appropriative and tone deaf. 2. There was a real emphasis on using
      permaculture knowledge in for-hire client work. Along with the previous issue, at times, the
      class felt like an exercise in extraction and recuperation. This seems to be a problem with
      permaculture as a whole though, and likely a topic for further writing in the future.

    <summary>Helped double the size of our community garden.</summary>
    <p>
      We came to an agreement with a neighbor that our working group would take over a larger, more
      publicly visible little tract next to a road. We dug and seeded five curbside rain basins with
      native plants, built some raised beds with sheltering from the afternoon sun, and started a
      massive lasagna compost.

      We started a mutual aid org (Tucson Distributed Farm) to help community members grow enough food

    <p>
      The community farm block was too far from Tucson for most people, so we started a mutual aid org
      (Tucson Distributed Farm) to help community members grow enough food for themselves and others.
      Our goal is to connect those that have access to land with those that do not. We help each other
      grow on the land and we all share in the abundance. Think mutual aid victory gardens with land-,
      labor-, and skill-share. We have three test locations running, with several more in various
      stages of planning or prep, and lots of interest!

    <summary>
      Drove from Tucson to Vermont and back with my partner and her dog, sleeping in the back of a
      pickup truck.
    </summary>
    <p>
      Visited friends and family in Memphis, Savannah, and Brooklyn on the way there. Then spent a week with friends in Detroit on the way back. We mostly avoided big cities and found camping spots in parks and pull-offs (the iOverlander app was an invaluable resource). A preferable alternative to the pricey hospitality hopping I’ve done on previous cross-country road trips.

    <summary>Spent a chunk of summer with my partner at a cabin in rural Vermont.</summary>
    <p>
      Rad weirdos all over! Off grid living: spring-fed water system, outdoor showering, minimal solar
      electricity, composting toilets. Also, beaver ponds, strawberry and blueberry picking, bear
      scat, aggressive horse flies, major flooding the best beer and cheese in the world.

    <summary>Learned how to build a staircase.</summary>
    <p>
      Fifteen steps, two turns, small cabin with very little room for error—incredibly difficult! My
      computer-pilled brain thought I could design the whole thing down to the 1/8” in software.
      Thankfully we realized this was wrong early on and redesigned to meet the ever-crookedness of
      the real world. A math mistake led to another partial tear down and rebuild. But we managed to
      get it right in the end.

    <summary>Learned how to install and repair metal roofing.</summary>
    <p>
      As soon as we arrived at the cabin we found that the very tippy top of a fallen cherry tree
      poked a 6” hole in a 9’x4’ metal roof panel. Thankfully the hole didn’t get past the protective
      barrier under the insulation, so no leaks. But replacing a panel of that size on a roof that’s
      15’ off the ground at a ~50+ degree slope proved to be /extremely/ difficult.

      Visited Bread and Puppet for a dirt mass, and again for a community dinner

     It’s a delightful community in an idyllic setting. I highly recommend stopping by if you are ever anywhere close: <a href="https://breadandpuppet.org">breadandpuppet.org</a>

    Successfully grew marijuana outdoors in the Sonoran desert in record-breaking summer heat
    (against all advice!).
  </summary>
  <p>
    I’m not a big pot smoker, but ever since realizing the greenness of my thumbs, I have wanted to
    grow pot. It’s legal to grow up to 6 plants here in AZ. A friend gave me 5 seedlings, which I
    put in the auto-irrigated part of my garden before we left for our 2.5 months road trip. Another
    friend came by to fertilize them with fish water every so often, but otherwise they were on
    their own for one of the hottest summers on record— 15 days over 110º F. Three of the five
    barely survived, scorched and stunted. But the other two— which I strategically planted in the
    afternoon shadow of a tall orange tree— grew to about 5’ and together produced somewhere around
    a pound of marijuana after drying. Half of that pound I accidentally over
