<h4> A little bit about the project:</h4>

  An interesting line of exploration developed in my solo music a few years ago. I found myself in Ableton Live slicing
  up songs into slivers of sound &mdash; often only long enough to get a single drum hit &mdash; and then rearranging
  them
  to form a beat or musical phrase. Here's a short example:

  After using this technique a few times in songs, and enjoying the results, I figured this was the sort of thing that
  would be better done with the aid of code.
  I found the <a href="https://github.com/algorithmic-music-exploration/amen">Amen library</a>, which does a great job
  of doing the slicing. It quickly finds "hits" in the song,
