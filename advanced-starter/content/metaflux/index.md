Hi!
I hope you like this theme and enjoy working with it. I've also made other themes! You can check them out here: [Gatsby
Starters](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-starters/).

If you want to see more of my work I recommend visiting my [personal portfolio](https://www.lekoarts.de). By pledging
to my [patreon campaign](https://www.patreon.com/lekoarts) you help me making more themes and creating more tutorials.
Thanks!
