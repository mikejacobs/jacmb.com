<section id="about">
        Mike Jacobs is a self-taught composer, software designer/coder, and artist living in Oakland. With one shoe stuck to the startup bubble gum, his days are spent sweating the earliest stages of software designâ€”where prototypes flower and the future oozes. Creative after-hours have his hands contorting and exploring technology for artistic purposes; finding beauty in the failures and limitations of the practical systems and data we have built up around ourselves. A selection of Mike's work can be found on his website: http://mjacobs.me/
